# ByJo - Your Finance Tracker

I developed a Finance Tracker app for iOS using Swift, designed to boost productivity by allowing users to track their income and expenses and visualize their data with dynamic, detailed charts for each category. In addition to its core functionality, the app includes a comparison feature for previous periods, helping users stay informed about their financial situation and make better decisions. The custom-built user interface offers a smooth and intuitive experience. All data is securely stored on iCloud, ensuring both speed and enhanced privacy.
